It's important to know that when Python interacts with a file like creating, reading, or writing a file, it puts a handle on that file. Think of this like a library hold. You can place a hold on a library book. When you do this, no one else can checkout that book except you. Well, in the file system, this is the same. Python's saying, \"I have a handle on this file, no one else make any changes to it or delete it\". This prevents two applications for making changes at the same time to the same file or deleting it.\n",
